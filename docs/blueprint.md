## Core Features:

- Display Content: Display HTML content within Telegram.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft blue (#A0C4FF) to complement Telegram's interface without overwhelming it.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a neutral backdrop that's easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#BDB2FF), used sparingly for highlights and interactive elements to add visual interest.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for both headers and body text to maintain readability and a clean appearance.
- Simple, outlined icons to represent actions or categories; use the Telegram icon style as inspiration.
- Clean, single-column layout optimized for mobile viewing within the Telegram app.
- Subtle transitions (e.g., fade-ins) for interactive elements to provide feedback without being distracting.
